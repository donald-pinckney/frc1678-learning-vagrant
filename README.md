# How to Install

1. Download VirtualBox: [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. Download Vagrant: [https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
3. Download 1678 Vagrant Box: [https://github.com/frc1678/vagrant-box/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/frc1678/vagrant-box/archive/master.zip)
4. If you are using Windows, you probably need a terminal that you can use to start Vagrant. You can download: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to download Git for Windows, which will also include a Bash Terminal.  If you are using Mac or Linux already, then just open the Terminal app you already have.
5. Open a command prompt, `cd` into the `vagrant-box` directory you just downloaded, and run `vagrant up`.
6. Once that completes, run `vagrant ssh`.
